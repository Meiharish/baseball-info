        <h2>What is Baseball?</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The game is played on a field with four bases arranged in a diamond shape. A batter from one team attempts to hit a pitched ball and run to a series of bases to score runs, while the other team tries to get the batter out by catching the ball or throwing it to the base before the runner gets there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Baseball History</h2>
        <p>The origins of baseball can be traced back to several bat-and-ball games played in Europe. The game evolved in North America in the 18th century and became a formalized sport with rules and organized competitions by the late 1800s. Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest professional level in the United States, with teams like the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago Cubs being some of the most famous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Baseball Rules</h2>
        <p>The game consists of nine innings, with each team having a turn to bat and a turn to field in each inning. A team scores a run when a player successfully reaches home plate after touching each of the four bases in order. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game. Players can be out in several ways, including being struck out, caught in the air, or tagged out by a defender holding the ball.</p>

        <div class="kit-list">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Baseball Bat:</strong> The bat is made of wood or metal and is used by the batter to hit the pitched ball. A good bat allows the player to hit the ball with power and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseball Glove:</strong> A glove is worn by fielders to catch the ball. It is made of leather and provides the necessary protection and control when catching or fielding the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseball Helmet:</strong> A helmet is worn by the batter to protect the head from injury while batting. It is typically made of durable plastic or composite materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Cleats:</strong> Baseball cleats are special shoes with spikes that help players maintain traction on the field while running or pivoting.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseball Uniform:</strong> The uniform consists of a jersey, pants, cap, and socks. Players wear uniforms to represent their team and for comfort during the game.</li>
